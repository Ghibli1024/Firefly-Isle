## Common commands

### OpenSpec workflow

- `openspec list --json` — list active changes and completion state
- `openspec status --change "<change-name>" --json` — inspect artifact status for a specific active change
- `openspec instructions apply --change "<change-name>" --json` — get implementation context and task list for an active change
- `openspec new change "<name>"` — create a new change when work needs a new spec track

### Current limitation

- Verified commands at the current baseline: `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run type-check:functions`, `npm run test`, `npm run dev`.
- Lint currently passes with warnings related to fast-refresh export boundaries in generated/shared modules; resolve those warnings as follow-up work instead of guessing around them.

### Current product architecture

- **Frontend:** Vite + React 18 + TypeScript SPA
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Backend/BaaS:** Supabase Auth + PostgreSQL + RLS + Edge Functions
- **Mobile shell:** Capacitor 8 iOS/Android wrapper around the same `dist` Web build; no separate native product UI or local patient-record truth source
- **Edge adapter:** Cloudflare Pages Functions host WeChat OAuth2 adapter prework for future Supabase custom provider compatibility; current login UI keeps WeChat deferred
- **AI boundary:** frontend calls a Supabase Edge Function proxy; system provider keys stay server-side, and user-owned provider keys are saved only through encrypted `llm_provider_settings` rows
- **Core workflow:** natural-language intake → structured extraction → up to 3 clarification rounds → timeline table render → inline editing → formal record page → AI auxiliary analysis / read-only sharing / PDF/PNG export
- **Demo workflow:** login page links to public `/demo` routes; Demo pages reuse the real record and analytics surfaces with a visible Demo reminder, optional Supabase public share-code record, unified sample patient/lab fallback data, static non-diagnostic AI analysis preview, disabled share preview and client-side export, without creating Supabase records from Demo
- **Privacy boundary:** first-use privacy gate and `/privacy` page share the same text source in `src/lib/privacy.ts`
- **Current truth sources:** behavior lives in `openspec/specs/**/*.md`; visual-system guidance starts at `DESIGN.md` and `docs/design/`; implementation details live in `src/`, `supabase/`, `.github/`, and `public/`; archive change designs are historical rationale, not the primary current-state entrypoint

### Core domain model

The app revolves around a `PatientRecord` with treatment history layers plus an independent lab trend collection:

1. `basicInfo` — demographics and diagnosis summary
2. `initialOnset` — optional early-stage/initial treatment block
3. `treatmentLines[]` — ordered advanced-treatment lines
4. `labResults[]` — optional repeated blood routine, blood biochemistry, and tumor-marker readings, kept independent from treatment lines

Rendering depends on three patient archetypes:

- `non-advanced` — basic info + initial onset only
- `de-novo-advanced` — basic info + treatment lines only
- `relapsed-advanced` — basic info + initial onset + treatment lines

Important domain rules from the specs:

- Basic info always renders first.
- `initialOnset` is shown only when present.
- `treatmentLines` are ordered by `lineNumber`.
- `labResults` are grouped by lab indicator and rendered as non-diagnostic trends.
- Immunohistochemistry and genetic-test data stay attached to each onset/treatment line, not in a shared summary section.
- Clinically important missing fields (`tumorType`, `stage`, `regimen`) should be visually highlighted for manual completion.

## Document hierarchy

When implementation starts, read these in roughly this order:

1. `README.md` — concise project purpose and current repo baseline
2. `docs/products/prd-implementation-status.md` — current PRD implementation status and pointers to archived product docs
3. `DESIGN.md` — project-level visual-system entrypoint, linking to the active detailed design source
4. `docs/products/archive/prd.md` — archived original user/problem framing and scope boundaries, when historical PRD context is needed
5. `openspec/specs/**/*.md` — current baseline behavior requirements
6. `src/**`, `supabase/**`, `.github/**`, `public/**` — current implementation reality and runtime boundaries
7. `openspec/changes/archive/**/design.md` — historical rationale only, when current behavior or past decisions need explanation

## Current architectural direction

The OpenSpec artifacts are aligned on these points:

- MVP keeps a thin `chat(messages, options)` adapter boundary.
- The LLM proxy supports system DeepSeek fallback plus user-owned Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, GLM, DeepSeek, Kimi, and custom OpenAI-style provider settings through a Supabase Edge Function boundary.
- The app now provides a user-facing LLM provider settings entry: no saved setting falls back to system DeepSeek, while user-owned preset/custom provider keys are saved through `llm-proxy/settings` with server-side encryption and RLS-backed storage.
- Data storage uses normalized `patients` + `treatment_lines` + `lab_report_batches` + `lab_results` tables with RLS; `lab_results` remains the single reading truth for web charts and monitoring, while `lab_report_batches` stores upload/OCR/review source facts.
- Read-only sharing uses `record_shares` with hashed authorization codes, revocation/expiration, active-share RLS, and a public `/share/:code` route that never exposes raw owner user ids.
- Lab analytics, clinical AI analysis, record sharing, TimelineTable, full-product Demo, and PWA foundation have been archived into baseline specs; future work should create new OpenSpec changes instead of editing archived contracts as active ledgers.

## Stitch note

If future work uses the archived Stitch artifacts in `docs/products/archive/stitch-screen-mapping.md`, treat `screenInstances.label` as the authoritative page name. Do not use `project.title` or `list_screens.title` as the source of truth.

## Working conventions already present

- Follow the spec-first workflow already encoded in the repo: adjust specs before implementing when requirements change.
- PR titles and squash-merge commit messages should follow Conventional Commits: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`.
- Commit granularity should follow OpenSpec/change boundaries. The repository default is to commit at completed Step boundaries, but if the active change documents a more specific recommended commit map, follow that map.
- Tasks are execution checklists, not an instruction to create one commit per checkbox.
- Only commit after the tests relevant to the commit's scope pass.
- Once code exists, keep repository documentation aligned with structural changes.
